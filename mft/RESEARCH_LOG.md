# Research Log - Scientific Method

**Date Started**: 2025-11-11  
**Goal**: Find profitable trading strategy for crypto futures  
**Method**: Systematic hypothesis testing with strict overfitting prevention

## Research Methodology

### Scientific Method Process:
1. **Hypothesis Formation**: State clear hypothesis about why strategy should work
2. **Experiment Design**: Define test period, metrics, success criteria
3. **Implementation**: Code the strategy
4. **Testing**: Run backtest on recent 60 days (2025-09-12 to 2025-11-11)
5. **Analysis**: Evaluate results against success criteria
6. **OOD Validation**: Train/test split (60% train, 40% test) to check overfitting
7. **Conclusion**: Accept/reject hypothesis, document learnings

### Success Criteria:
- ✅ Test return > 0%
- ✅ Test win rate ≥ 40%
- ✅ Test trades ≥ 20 (statistical significance)
- ✅ No overfitting (test performance within 20% of train)

### Overfitting Red Flags:
- ❌ Test performance much worse than train (>20% difference)
- ❌ Very few trades (<20)
- ❌ Optimizing parameters on test set
- ❌ Testing on different time periods to find favorable results

## Experiment Log

### Experiment 1: Moving Average Strategy (MA=20)

**Conclusion**: ⚠️ **INVESTIGATING** - ETHUSDT shows promise but train/test identical (possible bug in date filtering)  
**Learnings**: 
- ETHUSDT may be more predictable than other tickers
- Lower confidence threshold helps generate more trades
- **CRITICAL**: Need to verify why train/test results are identical - possible bug
- ML RF only works on ETHUSDT, fails on all other tickers tested

## Summary of Findings

### ✅ Promising Strategies (Need Verification):
1. **ML RF (50% conf) on ETHUSDT**: 287.58% return, 73.68% win rate ⚠️ NEEDS OOD VERIFICATION (bug detected)
2. **Order Flow on ETHUSDT**: 92.66% return, 50% win rate ⚠️ Too few trades (8)
3. **Volatility Clustering on ETHUSDT**: 83.88% return ⚠️ Too few trades (11)

### ❌ Rejected Strategies:
- MA (all periods tested)
- RSI Mean Reversion
- MACD
- Mean Reversion (Z-Score)
- Pairs Trading
- Volatility Breakout
- Momentum + MR Hybrid
- ML RF (60% conf) on AVAXUSDT/DOGEUSDT/SOLUSDT
- ML RF (50% conf) on DOGEUSDT/AVAXUSDT/BTCUSDT/GALAUSDT
- ML LR (all symbols)

### Key Observations:
1. **ETHUSDT is special**: Multiple strategies work on ETHUSDT but not other tickers
   - ML RF: 287.58% return (19 trades)
   - Order Flow: 92.66% return (8 trades)
   - Volatility Clustering: 83.88% return (11 trades)
2. **Trade frequency matters**: Strategies with <20 trades need more signals for statistical significance
3. **Win rate alone insufficient**: Need good risk/reward ratio
4. **ML shows promise**: But needs proper OOD validation (bug detected)
5. **Overfitting risk**: Train/test identical results suggest possible bug

### Critical Issues:
- ⚠️ **ML RF train/test identical**: Possible bug in date filtering or ML strategy retraining
- ⚠️ **Low trade frequency**: Order Flow (8 trades) and Volatility Clustering (11 trades) need more signals
- ⚠️ **ETHUSDT-specific**: Strategies don't generalize to other tickers

## Next Steps

### Priority 1: Verify ETHUSDT ML RF Results
- [ ] Investigate why train/test results are identical
- [ ] Run proper OOD validation with different date ranges
- [ ] Check if all 19 trades are in one period
- [ ] Verify results aren't due to data issues

### Priority 2: Improve Promising Strategies
- [ ] Increase trade frequency for Order Flow (lower threshold?)
- [ ] Increase trade frequency for Volatility Clustering
- [ ] Test ensemble: ML RF + Order Flow + Volatility Clustering

### Priority 3: Continue Research
- [ ] Test strategies on different timeframes (15m, 1h, 4h)
- [ ] Test on more tickers to see if ETHUSDT success generalizes
- [ ] Investigate why ETHUSDT is more predictable
- [ ] Try market regime detection

## Research Notes

**2025-11-11**: Started systematic research log following scientific method. Documenting all experiments with clear hypotheses, results, and conclusions.

**Key Insight**: ETHUSDT shows consistent profitability across multiple strategies, suggesting it may have more predictable patterns than other tickers. Need to verify this isn't overfitting.
